Hi, I'm Felix Luo. I'm currently focusing on web3 and blockchain, also a full stack engineer.
This is [my blog](https://felixgibson.github.io/). I'll post an article every week. And the content is about weekly reading and some thoughts. 
Hope you will enjoy it. You can contact me at jjtom5f@gmail.com.
